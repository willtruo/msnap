<!--BODY PARAGRAPHS-->
<p>With the existing solutions in clothing for those with mobility/physical impairments, many limitations are still present. These solutions can include; permanent clothing alterations, external and cumbersome tools, and adaptive clothing. <br><br>With these often bespoke solutions, there are clear prohibitive barriers for users in terms of bespoke solutions, invasiveness of permanent alterations to clothing, limited choice in fashion/expression, and potential high costs.
The benefits sought in this project is to allow for individual freedom of expressions by reducing the existing limitations in clothing for those with mobility/physical impairments.

    The sheer diversity in users makes this process incredibly challenging, and often an impossible task to complete. However, like every person around us, designers should strive to adapt and face these challenges in an ever changing world.</p><br><br>

<p class="deck">Actions, Capabilities, and Usefulness</p>
<!--BODY PARAGRAPHS-->
<p>Clothing fasteners have seen little iteration over the years, with buttons being the most common standard across all clothing. At its core, a fastener must be a simple mechanical function to hold two separate ends of an article of clothing closed, sometimes with added functionality of adjusting tightness or leaving it partially open.<br><br>

A new standard for fasteners must retain the existing functionality, while improving on other aspects (primarily accessibility). This would allow for the adoption of the new fastener through atelier/manufacturer supply chains to be implemented in various articles of clothing. <br><br>

At the core of the project, the usefulness will pertain to those with physical impairments. With many fasteners being problematic or difficult to use, finding clothing options to allow for individual freedoms can be difficult. Ideally, a new standard would expand on the current offerings or selections available to consumers, at no additional cost to their wallet or expression.

<p class="deck">How will users interact?</p>
<!--BODY PARAGRAPHS-->
<p>While designing for the user is the primary purpose; manufacturers, suppliers, and fashion designers must be considered as well. In order to reach the most amount of users, the fastener must be an affordable and easy-to-implement solution. This is in hopes that, should this project be pursued further, the design can propagate in fashion circles and adopted by other clothing manufacturers. This would be the most seamless method of getting the design into as many user’s hands as possible.

<p class="deck">What does this allow users to do?</p>
<!--BODY PARAGRAPHS-->
<p>
A new adaptable fastener could expand on the options available to those with physical impairments, allowing them to gain a level of independence without hindering their self-expression. The need for creativity and self-actualization is present in everyone, and inclusive design can expand on the amount of users that can benefit from this.
